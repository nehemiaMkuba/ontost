## Auto Authentication for Developers

To streamline the development process, you can set up automatic authentication by creating an account and assigning the following environment variables:

| Variable      | Value |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `DEV_ENV`     | `true`       |
| `USER_EMAIL`  | `your_email`  |
| `USER_PASSWORD` | `your_password` |

Once you set up these environment variables, you will be logged in automatically when you run the WebService locally.
